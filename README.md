# Doodle-jump-project

    Small game project, realize in HTML CSS pure and JavaScript, No Canva ✌🏽👌🏽✅ .
## Instructions:
    
    Have a ball on a support
    
    The ball can be directed by the left and right direction shower of the keyboard, the up key, prevents the ball from going left, nor right, that is to say to stabilize.
    
    As we evolve, other supports appear at the top and those that touch the bottom disappear.
    
    The game end when the ball touch down, in other words by entering the red area.
